# Electric Vehicle Insights Dashboard

## Introduction

In this data analysis project, I have created a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to analyze insights on electric vehicles. The dataset includes information about electric vehicle registrations, their models, makes, eligibility, and geographic distribution. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the adoption and distribution of electric vehicles across different states, makes, and models.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
- **Model Year**: The year the vehicle model was released.
- **State**: The state where the vehicle is registered.
- **Make**: The manufacturer of the vehicle.
- **Model**: The model of the vehicle.
- **CAFE Eligibility**: Indicates if the vehicle is eligible for the Clean Air Vehicle (CAV) program.
- **Total Vehicles**: The total number of registered electric vehicles.

## Tools and Software

For this project, I used Tableau as the primary tool for data analysis and visualization. Tableau provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for creating interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Tableau Dashboard**: The complete data analysis process, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
2. **Visualizations**: A variety of charts, graphs, and maps to support key findings and insights.
3. **Final Report**: A comprehensive summary of the analysis, insights, and recommendations.

## Visualizations

1. **Total Vehicles by Model Year**: A bar chart showing the total number of electric vehicles by model year.
 

2. **Total Vehicles by State**: A map showing the total number of electric vehicles by state.
 

3. **Total Vehicles by Make**: A bar chart showing the total number of electric vehicles by make.
  

4. **Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility**: A pie chart showing the distribution of vehicles by Clean Air Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.


5. **Total Vehicles by Model**: A bar chart showing the total number of electric vehicles by model.


## Conclusion

This data analysis project in Tableau provides valuable insights into the electric vehicle market. The interactive visualizations help in understanding the distribution of electric vehicles by model year, state, make, eligibility, and model. By the end of the project, we aim to uncover actionable recommendations that can drive informed decision-making and strategic planning in the electric vehicle industry, all within the user-friendly environment of Tableau.
